Connect Four / Project 1
This is my first project for PerScholas. This is my version of a DOM based Connect Four game. 
My version of the game can be found here: https://stantheblan.github.io/connectFour/

Each player takes turns to try to connect 4 pieces of their color together in the different slots. 
- This checks horizontally, vertically, diagonal left, and diagonal right.
